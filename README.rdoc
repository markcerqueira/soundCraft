= LOrkCraft
<em>Sonification of a Starcraft 2 Game!</em>

== FILES
1. *lorkCraftShipyard.SC2Map* - the Antiga Shipyard map (forced cross-spawns at the 5 and 11 o'clock positions) with the custom data-collecting triggers applied to it
2. *bank_parser.rb* - Ruby script that parses the XML bank files written by our custom map and dispatches OSC messages
3. *audio.ck* - prototype audio synthesizer written in ChucK that receives OSC messages from the bank parser to produce sound 

== DATA FLOW
User data is collected as events occur (e.g. minerals collected, units die) or at fixed polling intervals (collecting APM, research progress) and written to XML bank files. Unfortunately, this is the only legitimate way to get data out of Starcraft 2, but so far the latency does not seem bad given we can control how often we poll for changes to these bank files. A Ruby script monitors the folder containing the bank files using guard/listen[https://github.com/guard/listen] and when those files are modified, the XML files are parsed using Nokogiri[http://nokogiri.org/] and OSC messages are dispatched using OSC. Any OSC listener can catch those messages and process them to display data or produce sound.

== CUSTOM MAP INFO
=== DATA COLLECTED BY MAP
* Write supply every time supply is used/made
* Write vespene collected/current count every time it changes
* Write mineral collected/current count every time it changes
* Write out messages a user types in chat
* When a unit/building is built write out current army/building composition
* Write general user info every second. This currently includes:
  * APM
  * Average Minerals Stockpiled 
  * Average Vespene Stockpiled
  * Mineral Collection Rate
  * Vespene Collection Rate
  * Enemy Structures Razed
  * Enemy Units Killed
  * Mineral Value of Units Lost 
  * Total Resource Value of Army
  * Workers Trained
  * Workers Lost
  * Total Overview Score
  * Supplies Used
  * ResourceLostAll
  * Idle Production Time
  * Combat Efficiency

=== In Progress/Coming Soon
* When units are given a command, write out command (attack/move) and destination
* When a unit/building dies write out write out current army/building composition
* When a player moves the camera write out location user is looking at
* Write out unit production progress status every second
* Write out research progress status every second
